### Credits

This application is originally based on https://f1-start.glitch.me/, which I discovered through this video.
Credits to @jakearchibald for the original concept and @jan25 for the initial VueJS implementation.

I forked and styled this version â€” check out the modified version here ttps://github.com/jan25/f1-lights.git
